        "1. **Pixels**: The smallest unit of a digital image. Each pixel represents a single point in the image and holds information about its color or intensity. Images are usually organized in a grid of pixels (rows and columns).\n",
        "2. **Resolution**: The total number of pixels in the image, typically given as width × height (e.g., 1920×1080). Higher resolution means more detail.\n",
        "3. **Bit Depth**: Refers to the number of bits used to represent the color or intensity of each pixel.\n",
        "4. **Common values**: 8-bit grayscale = 256 levels of intensity. 24-bit color = 8 bits per channel for RGB (Red, Green, Blue).\n",
        "5. **Color Model**: Defines how colors are represented. The most common model for digital images is RGB (Red, Green, Blue). Each pixel in a color image is represented by three values corresponding to the R, G, and B channels.\n",

For a grayscale image, it is a 2D array where each element is a pixel intensity (e.g., 0 = black, 255 = white). For a color image, it is a 3D array: width × height × 3 (for RGB values). Images can be stored in various file formats such as JPEG, PNG, BMP, etc., which may include compression and metadata.\n",

        "- **Definition**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized type of deep learning model designed primarily for processing grid-like data, such as images. They automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images through a series of layers. CNNs use a mathematical operation called convolution instead of relying on full connectivity (as in traditional neural networks). This operation helps to extract local features like edges, textures, and shapes.\n",

        "Reduces the need for manual feature extraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Enables deep networks to learn hierarchical representations — from low-level (edges) to high-level (shapes, objects).\n",
        "\n",
        "📌 2. Filters (Kernels) and the Convolution Operation\n",
        "A filter or kernel is a small matrix (e.g., 3×3 or 5×5) of trainable weights used in the convolution operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 How Filters Work:\n",
        "A filter slides over the input image, computing element-wise multiplications with overlapping parts of the input.\n",
        "\n",
        "The results are summed to produce a single value in the output feature map.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each filter is designed to detect a specific feature (e.g., vertical edge, corner, color pattern).\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple filters are used in each convolutional layer, producing multiple feature maps.\n",
        "\n",
        "📌 3. Padding in Convolutional Layers\n",
        "Padding refers to adding extra pixels (typically zeros) around the edges of the input image before applying convolution.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 Types of Padding:\n",
        "Valid Padding: No padding; results in a smaller output.\n",
        "\n",
        "Same Padding: Pads input so output has the same dimensions as input.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 Why Padding Is Used:\n",
        "To preserve spatial size (important in deep networks).\n",
        "\n",
        "To allow filters to reach edge pixels.\n",
        "\n",
        "To control the size of the output feature map.\n",
        "\n",
        "📌 4. Strides in Convolutional Layers\n",
        "Stride defines how far the filter moves across the input in each step.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔹 Effect of Stride:\n",
        "Stride = 1: Filter slides one pixel at a time → output retains more detail.\n",
        "\n",
        "Stride > 1: Filter jumps by 2+ pixels → output is smaller and more compressed.\n",
        "\n",
